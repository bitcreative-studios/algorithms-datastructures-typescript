## Exercise

You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single digit. Thedigits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1'sdigit isat the head of the list. Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.

Number: 104, List1: 4 -> 0 -> 1
Number: 997, List2: 7 -> 9 -> 9

List1 + List2: 1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 1
