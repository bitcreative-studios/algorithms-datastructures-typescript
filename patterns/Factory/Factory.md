# Factory Pattern

In Factory pattern, we create object without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to newly created object using a common interface.

"Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. The Factory method lets a class defer instantiation it uses to subclasses." (Gang Of Four)
